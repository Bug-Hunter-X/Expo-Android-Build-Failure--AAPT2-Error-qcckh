This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with the error message "Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'. > AAPT2 aapt2-4.1.0-6812282...".  This is often caused by issues with the Android resource files (XML, images, etc.). It can stem from incorrect resource naming, missing or conflicting resources, or even problems with the AndroidManifest.xml file. The error message is not very specific, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact problem without further investigation.
